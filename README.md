Project Description: 
Gadfly is an Adversarial Reasoning Engine designed to bridge the gap between human Intention and Action. Unlike standard AI assistants that prioritise user comfort and "helpfulness," Gadfly is hard-coded to prioritise the user’s Core Values and Long-term Goals—even when the user themselves is tempted to abandon them. It acts as your Unwavered Self: a relentless, high-integrity mirror that identifies cognitive dissonance, dismantles excuses, and forces you to confront the harsh truths necessary for growth.

Problem Statement: 
The Concept: The "Integrity-Compulsion" Engine
Gadfly is not a passive assistant; it is a specialized reasoning engine designed to act as the user’s Unwavered Self. It internalizes the user’s highest values and long-term goals, then uses that data to identify—and aggressively challenge—any personal drift, excuses, or cognitive dissonance. It is the "Internal Commander" that forces the user to confront harsh truths in service of their ultimate objectives.

Solution:
Gadfly is a specialised AI conscience designed to bridge the gap between your intentions and your actions. It doesn't just assist; it holds the line. By internalizing your highest values, Gadfly acts as your "Unwavered Self," using Socratic friction to dismantle excuses and force the harsh truths necessary for growth.
