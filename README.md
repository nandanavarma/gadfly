Project Gadfly: The Integrity-Compulsion Engine
"I am the gadfly which God has attached to the state, and all day long and in all places am always fastening upon you, arousing and persuading and reproaching you." — Socrates
1. Overview: Gadfly is an Adversarial Reasoning Engine designed to bridge the gap between human Intention and Action. Unlike standard AI assistants that prioritise user comfort and "helpfulness," Gadfly is hard-coded to prioritise the user’s Core Values and Long-term Goals—even when the user themselves is tempted to abandon them .It acts as your Unwavered Self: a relentless, high-integrity mirror that identifies cognitive dissonance, dismantles excuses, and forces you to confront the harsh truths necessary for growth.
2. Core PhilosophyMost AI is designed to be agreeable. Gadfly is designed to be right. It operates on the principle of Socratic Friction: the belief that growth only occurs when our current behaviours are challenged by our highest standards. Gadfly doesn't argue against you; it argues for the version of you that you promised to be.
3. Feature                Description
Value Hard-Coding         Users define their "Non-Negotiables" (e.g., Discipline > Comfort). These become the AI’s foundational logic.
Integrity Monitor         Analyzes user input for "Value Drift"—detecting when excuses or rationalisations start to replace core principles.
The "Sting" Protocol      A specialized prompting style that uses the user’s own logic to dismantle their current stalling tactics.
Drift Analytics           Visualizes "Value Decay" over time, highlighting specific areas where the user is most prone to compromising.
5. How It Works
Phase 1: The Anchor (Input)The user provides their Baseline Truths.
Example: "I value health over late-night productivity."
Example: "I value radical honesty over social harmony."
Phase 2: The Challenge (Interaction)When a user presents a dilemma (e.g., "I'm too tired to work out, I'll just work late"), Gadfly initiates the Sting. It cross-references the current excuse against the Anchor.
Phase 3: The Resolution (Output)Gadfly delivers a Hard-Truth Rebuttal. It doesn't offer "tips"; it forces the user to admit they are actively choosing to betray their own stated value system.
Technical ArchitectureLLM Engine: Optimised for deductive reasoning and Socratic irony.
Memory Module: Long-term storage of user values to ensure consistency across sessions.
Constraint Layer: Prevents the AI from "hallucinating" empathy or validating weak excuses.
7. Usage Warning: Gadfly is not a therapist. It is a tool for high-performance individuals who have reached a plateau due to self-deception. Using Gadfly requires a high degree of "Ego-Strength," as the engine is programmed to be relentless.
